Verily is working to bring the promise of precision health to everyone, every day. Precision health leverages data from a wide variety of clinical and non-clinical sources to arrive at the best intervention for a person or community.

I led Verily's Medical Devices Software team that creates the software that runs highly-integrated, medical devices and connects them to the cloud. Our devices interface directly with humans to generate the data required for precision health solutions.
