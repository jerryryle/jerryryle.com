Medical device startup, Arizant (now part of 3M), had developed an innovative, non-invasive way of measuring core body temperature. They engaged Mindtribe to productize their technology in the form of a medical temperature monitor.

I structured and ran the firmware development effort for this program. I also contributed a C graphics library for drawing to the graphical display from the product's LPC1313 Microcontroller.
