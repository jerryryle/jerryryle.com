A large telecommunications provider was interested in developing their own media tablet for content delivery (similar to a set-top box, but mobile). Since they were not familiar with hardware development, they asked Mindtribe to help them architect the system.

The client was specifically interested in what operating systems would be appropriate for such a device and how they might go about enabling 3rd party applications. I put together a body of research and a presentation to educate them about the options.
