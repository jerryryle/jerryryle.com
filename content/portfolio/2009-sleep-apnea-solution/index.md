Apnicure engaged Mindtribe to develop a better treatment for sleep apnea that is quiet and allows users to breathe naturally through their nose without being restricted by a mask. Mindtribe worked with ID and mechanical engineering firm, Whipsaw, to create this product. Mindtribe developed the electrical and firmware designs and supported Whipsaw on the mechanical design.

I structured and ran the firmware and application development for this product, managing our team and an additional consultant. We built firmware that runs on an Atmel AT32UC3A1256 microcontroller, which performs the pump control, data logging, and communications. We also wrote firmware for a Cypress CY8C21334 PSoC to perform capacitive sensing for fluid level detection. We created several C# Windows applications designed to allow physicians to configure treatment parameters and retrieve usage logs.
