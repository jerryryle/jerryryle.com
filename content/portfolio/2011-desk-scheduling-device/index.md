A design company engaged Mindtribe to help them develop a prototype for a desk scheduling device for office environments with shared desks. This was to be a small, low power, cost-effective, networked device that could be deployed to hundreds of desks in large enterprise environments.

I structured and managed this program. I worked closely with the client to understand and capture the requirements. Working with a project manager, I put together schedules and budgets for the program and worked with the team to evaluate unit costs as we underwent component selection.

We built a functional prototype that drove a display and communicated via Zigbee. We used a Renesas RX62N microcontroller, which offered a means of driving a TFT display without the expense of a full TFT interface.
