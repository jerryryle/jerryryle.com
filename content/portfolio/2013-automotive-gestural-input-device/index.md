A large automotive manufacturer wanted to explore gesture-based input in an automotive
application.

I structured and ran a development effort to prototype an input device that uses a unique touchpad to
convert gestures into alphanumeric input. The prototype communicated with the touchpad via USB and
performed gestural processing in Python, using Kivy to provide a GUI that visualized the
results.
