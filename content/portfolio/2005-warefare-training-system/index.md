SRI International built a system called DFIRST&trade; that uses GPS satellites, wireless communications, and digital terrain map displays to create an instrumented environment for combat unit training. This system allows a unit to run through a training exercise and then analyze it later in a video-game like setting. SRI awarded Mindtribe "Subcontractor of the Year" for our work in helping them realize this system.

I led a large development effort to create firmware for multiple interface systems that gather and fuse disparate sensor data and transmit it wirelessly to a base station. The sensors include GPS, accelerometers, gyroscopes, and inclinometers. Each interface system runs on battery power and provides a local UI for configuration and diagnostics. The systems incorporate numerous processors including PIC microcontrollers and x86 single board computers.
