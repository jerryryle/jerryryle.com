In 2017, I joined [Mike Hanuschik](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaelhanuschik/) in creating the consumer healthcare startup, Alpine Oral Tech, Inc. (d.b.a. Alpine Health), which later renamed to Fresh Health. Fresh is developing a device that has the potential to help billions live healthier, longer lives.
