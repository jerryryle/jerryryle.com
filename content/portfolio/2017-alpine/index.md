In 2017, I joined [Mike Hanuschik](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaelhanuschik/) in creating the consumer healthcare startup, Alpine Oral Tech, Inc., which later became Fresh Health. Fresh Health is developing the [Proclaim Custom-Jet Oral Health System](https://proclaimhealth.com/pages/how-it-works) that has the potential to help billions live healthier, longer lives. I helped Mike bootstrap the company, hire our first engineers, and develop patents and prototypes to secure additional funding. While I was largely working in a leadership/management capacity, I got hands-on where needed. Specifically, I enjoyed the following eclectic projects:

* I helped set up our Google Cloud project where we were running computational fluid dynamics simulations for jet development.
* I designed and built a hardware/software experiment platform capable of controlling high pressure fluids while acquiring data about pressure and flow. For this, I designed and manufactured a custom PCBA and developed experimenter-friendly software in Python.
* I invented a shear-force surrogate material that we could reliably and repeatedly apply to teeth models to determine whether our jet designs were improving. The material allowed for consistent application and photographed well so that we could easily measure and quantify our results.
