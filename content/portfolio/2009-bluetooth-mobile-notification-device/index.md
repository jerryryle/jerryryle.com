Before the era of smart watches, a startup had an idea to create a mobile notification device that would allow users to see incoming call information and put calls on hold without digging their phones out of their pockets or purses. This startup worked with Mindtribe to help refine their prototype for fundraising purposes.

I managed and contributed to the development of the product's firmware, which runs on a CSR chipset designed for Bluetooth communications.
