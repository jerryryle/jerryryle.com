An input device company asked Mindtribe to help them explore a novel way of providing low-cost
multi-touch input using capacitive sensing elements and a traditional single-touch touchpad.

I structured and managed a program to develop firmware for a Cypress CY8C24894 PSoC. This firmware
enumerates as a USB HID device and combines capacitive sensing elements and touchpad data to emulate
a multitouch input device.
