When Sifteo began building their interactive gaming platform, they asked Mindtribe for product development input. We put together a workshop to help them detail out the product features, understand requirements, and begin to flesh out a system architecture.

I led the firmware portion of this workshop and followed up with specific architectural help as questions arose.
