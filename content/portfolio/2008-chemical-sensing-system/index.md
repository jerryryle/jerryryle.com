A chemical sensing technology startup engaged Mindtribe to help them productize their technology for detecting minute traces of harmful chemicals.

I structured and managed this program, which included an electrical and firmware effort to create a battery powered prototype capable of using our client's technology to detect harmful chemicals and wirelessly transmit status to a base station. We built an embedded Linux platform with a DSP co-processor capable of driving the MEMS sensor and acquiring/processing data from it.
