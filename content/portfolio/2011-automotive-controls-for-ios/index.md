Having [successfully demonstrated iPod Out](#ipod-out-automotive-integration), the Toyota InfoTechnology Center USA asked Mindtribe to help them add new input devices to their system that
would allow drivers more control over the iPhone.

I structured and led the effort to write firmware for a Cypress CY8C24894 PSoC that connected to Toyota's head unit and sent button information via USB.
