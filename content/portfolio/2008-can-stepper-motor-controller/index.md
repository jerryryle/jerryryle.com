A medical device company building protein analysis tools engaged Mindtribe to help them build a
CAN-based motor controller that would be used to drive multiple motors within their products.

I structured and managed this program, which involved designing the motor control boards and writing
firmware for a Microchip PIC18F2682 Microcontroller to drive stepper motors based upon commands sent
over a CAN bus. Though I largely played a management role, I also lent firmware expertise and helped
out with the development.
