Mindtribe helped a medical device startup create an over-the-air (OTA) firmware update mechanism for
their Bluetooth LE (BLE) device.

I managed this program and planned/oversaw a development effort to create a bootloader, BLE OTA
update protocol, and a macOS test application. While my team performed the entirety of the
implementation, I assisted in the architecture and quality assurance of our deliverables.
