A leading industrial geopositioning company engaged Mindtribe to develop a computer vision system
prototype as part of an ongoing R&amp;D effort to add advanced navigation capabilities to their existing
systems. Mindtribe built a system capable of recording and storing GPS-synchronized, high-resolution
video from multiple cameras.

I helped configure a rugged computer with the exceptional memory and storage bandwidth needed to
capture and record video from multiple cameras simultaneously. I also wrote firmware for an NXP
LPC2148 Microcontroller that manages the synchronization of the camera triggering with a GPS. The
firmware transmits timestamped information via USB to the host PC that captures and records
video.
