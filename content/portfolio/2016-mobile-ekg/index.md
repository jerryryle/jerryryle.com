A medical device startup asked Mindtribe to help them develop a new version of their existing mobile EKG product.

I led a team of mechanical and electrical engineers to take the new design to production. We identified and solved several signal integrity and power management issues, which ultimately led to the product's success. We developed a factory test procedure and traveled to Shenzhen, China where we worked with an injection molder and contract manufacturer to take the design through a successful production build.
