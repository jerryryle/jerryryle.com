A startup offering mobile charging as a service was having quality problems with their devices. The
service operates via a deployment of smart batteries throughout urban areas. When users encounter
these smart batteries and connect their phones, they're prompted to sign into the startup's service
to pay for the battery usage. Unfortunately, the batteries would not reliably connect to various
Android phones. The issues seemed to be a combination of firmware and app-level bugs. Because of our
prior Android accessory and app experience, Mindtribe was asked to help debug the issues.

I managed this program and planned/oversaw a short sprint during which my team debugged the issues
while I lent USB expertise to the program.
