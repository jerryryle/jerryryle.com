A large consumer electronics manufacturer wanted to explore improvements to TV remote controls and
on-screen user interfaces.

I structured and ran a development effort to prototype a new remote control that incorporates capacitive sensing elements. We partnered with local user experience design and development firm, [Stimulant](https://stimulant.com), who developed the on-screen TV experience that our hardware controls. To accelerate Stimulant's development and integration of our work, we built an Android-based remote control simulator that they used while our hardware was under development. Once our hardware was ready, it took just a few hours to replace the simulator with the actual hardware and re-tune the system.
