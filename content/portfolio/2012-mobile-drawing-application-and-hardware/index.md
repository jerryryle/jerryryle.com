Adobe engaged Mindtribe to help them explore the use of hardware to enhance the mobile drawing experience and bring back the familiar experience of drawing with pen and paper. We built a connected stylus capable of producing beautiful strokes on an iPad. To support this effort, Mindtribe wrote an iOS app to test and demonstrate the drawing capability of the stylus. During this program, Adobe asked us to also explore the concept of a hardware ruler for technical drawing. We prototyped this ruler and extended our test app with new functionality to support it. Around this time, we were collectively coming to the conclusion that these prototypes were more than intriguing concepts&mdash;they were potentially-shippable products.

Adobe decided to proceed with the productization of the pen and ruler, to be sold as [Adobe Ink and Slide](https://helpx.adobe.com/ink-and-slide.html). They felt that evolving our test app into a polished drawing app as a skunkworks project would be a faster path to a showcase app for the new drawing accessories than trying to get the hardware support integrated into Adobe's existing apps.

We dedicated Mindtribe developers to the application and I stepped in to manage it as its own program&mdash;codenamed Project Parallel. I worked with Adobe's project manager to put together a production schedule that aligned with the hardware release. Together, we ran the program using an agile methodology. The team met weekly to plan each sprint and delivered features by demonstrating them at the subsequent planning meeting. The iOS developers worked closely with Adobe's designers and Mindtribe's hardware team to reduce integration cycles to hours. We moved blazingly fast.

As the program progressed, we added iOS developers from Adobe to increase our velocity and incorporate Adobe technologies such as Creative Cloud. I engaged Adobe's internationalization team to help us plan early for internationalization and to perform the actual localization for the countries in which the product would launch. I later engaged Adobe's quality assurance resources to help us set up automated UI testing and to perform manual application testing with the hardware.

Early in the program, I contributed to the iOS development itself; however, I was lucky enough to have an exceptionally capable team and many Adobe resources, so I was able to step back and focus on removing all program-level obstacles from their path.

Together, Adobe and Mindtribe shipped a beautiful and capable product called [Adobe Line](https://helpx.adobe.com/mobile-apps/how-to/line-perspective-draw.html) that became a model for app development within Adobe. We met with other iOS teams within Adobe and shared our experience and methodology.
