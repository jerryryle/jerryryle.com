The manufacturer of a portable network analyzer worked with Mindtribe to redesign aspects of their handheld analyzer.

I structured and led an electrical effort to redesign the network analyzer to make it more suitable for production. While I largely played a management role, I helped with electrical component research and gave feedback about the electrical architecture with an eye towards easing the client's firmware development effort on the new platform.
