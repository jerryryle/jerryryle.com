A medical device startup is creating an innovative surgical robotics system. They engaged Mindtribe to create a medical-grade input device that surgeons will use to control the robots.

I led the first half of this ongoing program, overseeing a team of mechanical, electrical, and firmware engineers working towards a production-intent prototype. We collaborated with the client and an industrial design firm to create experiential prototypes to narrow down the form factor and ergonomic concerns. In parallel, we gathered system requirements, performed an FMEA to understand how we were going to address safety issues, researched sterilization solutions, and kicked off the system architecture.

Interesting technologies we researched during this program included industrial communication protocols such as EtherCAT, sterilization methods such as ethylene oxide and STERRADÂ®, and electrical and firmware-level error mitigation/redundancy. The system was built with an NXP Kinetis K65 ARM Cortex-M4F microcontroller.

I left Mindtribe during this program, so I transitioned it to another Mindtribe VP. Our client had originally planned to take the design into production themselves; however, our work impressed them and, after I left, they extended Mindtribe's involvement to help them through production.
