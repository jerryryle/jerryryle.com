A video telestration startup had contracted a firm in India to develop a large software application
that would run on a hardware appliance and allow users to control and annotate live video.
Unfortunately, the startup was encountering severe quality issues with the deliverables from the
contractor. They originally reached out to Mindtribe to explore the possibility of having us start
over.

I evaluated the situation and the code from the other team. I determined that the codebase was not a
lost cause, that it made no economic sense to throw it out and start over, and that the quality
problems stemmed largely from a communication issue between our client and their contractor. Our
client did not have experience providing technical specifications, so they were giving the
development team poor direction. The development team was largely guessing at what needed to be
built. This was compounded by the geographic separation of the teams. To correct this, I sat down
with the client and worked with them until I had a detailed understanding of their desired
functionality and I had clarified points of ambiguity. I translated this into a detailed software
specification for the contractor. With this improved mutual understanding of what was being built,
the relationship between our client and their contractor improved dramatically.

I do not believe in communicating exclusively through specifications; however, sometimes they are the
best tool for aligning stakeholders and teams.
