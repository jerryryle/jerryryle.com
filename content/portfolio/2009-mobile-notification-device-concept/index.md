A large consumer electronics company was creating a smart watch that would allow users to see incoming call and text information on their wrists. They asked Mindtribe to help with specific technical investigations and proofs of concept.

I helped develop OLED display drivers and optimized routines for scrolling and navigating graphical data on an OLED from a very resource constrained microcontroller. I delivered C code that demonstrates these routines, running on TI LM3S9B96 and LM3S1811 microcontrollers.
