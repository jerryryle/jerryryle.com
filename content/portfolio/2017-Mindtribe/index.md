I joined Mindtribe as the sixth employee in January of 2001. Over the subsequent 16 years, I helped build Mindtribe into a 40 person, world-class engineering firm. As a partner and vice president, I was responsible for business development, sales, engineering management, program management, process development, strategy, hiring, and mentorship.

During my time at Mindtribe, I figuratively wore a number of hats (few literally as I'm not a hat person). Being a small team, we each had to sport a "get things done" attitude. In addition to engineering, writing proposals, and fielding sales leads, my early role at Mindtribe included managing our IT, building our websites, creating documentation templates and process tools, acting as project librarian, cleaning the office, making coffee, and ensuring that everyone got a cake on their birthday.

As Mindtribe grew, I grew along with it. I became a more effective leader. I learned how to work better with others and amplify their abilities. I became more confident and less afraid to give or receive feedback. I learned that I didn't need to do everything myself and handed off responsibilities for which others were more effective. I developed deep engineering skills and insights spanning numerous technologies and industries.

I now enjoy applying what I learned at Mindtribe to grow new companies.
