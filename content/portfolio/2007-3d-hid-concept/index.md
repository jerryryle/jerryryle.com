Having achieved success in the gaming market with their [3D Mouse](#3d-mouse), Sandio began exploring new 3D input device concept that used a fusion of multiple touchpads to provide precise and intuitive 3D control of virtual objects.

I structured and managed the electrical and firmware development effort for this program. The firmware was written in C for a Cypress CY7C64215 microcontroller. It appears as a USB HID device and translates the touchpad input into 3D control.
