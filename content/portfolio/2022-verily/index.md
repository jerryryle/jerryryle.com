Verily is working to bring the promise of precision health to everyone, every day. Precision health leverages data from a wide variety of clinical and non-clinical sources to arrive at the best intervention for a person or community.

I led Verily's Medical Devices Software organization, which included teams of embedded, mobile, and cloud developers. We created the software that runs Verily's highly-integrated, medical devices and connects them to the cloud. Our devices interface directly with humans to generate the data required for precision health solutions.

During my time at Verily, my teams brought three significant cloud-connected hardware and software products from early development to shipping, while also supporting a number of other internal development programs.
