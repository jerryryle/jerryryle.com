Verily is working to bring the promise of precision health to everyone, every day. Precision health leverages data from a wide variety of clinical and non-clinical sources to arrive at the best intervention for a person or community.

As head of Verily's Medical Devices Software organization, I directed five teams of embedded, mobile, and cloud developers. These teams worked on five separate programs, each having significant scope and cross-functional collaboration with other Verily teams and external partners. We created the software that runs Verily's highly-integrated, medical devices and connects them to the cloud. Our devices interface directly with humans to generate the data required for precision health solutions.

During my time at Verily, my teams brought three significant cloud-connected hardware and software products from early development to shipping, while also supporting a number of other research and development programs.
