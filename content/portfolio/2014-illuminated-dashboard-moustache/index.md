[Lyft](https://www.lyft.com), the popular ride sharing service that is headquartered in SF, engaged Mindtribe to work with [Ammunition](https://ammunitiongroup.com) to overhaul Lyft's iconic, fuzzy "carstache". Our mission was to create a smaller, sleeker, more refined emblem that maintained the superb brand recognition Lyft had earned with their standout 'stache.

We began by supporting Ammunition's concept creation/refinement phase through a series of studies and prototypes to understand safety concerns, costs, and feasibility.

Once Lyft and Ammunition selected the final "glowstache" concept, Mindtribe created the detailed mechanical, electrical, and firmware design. The glowstache was effectively a very fancy flashlight. It had an internal battery that recharged via a USB port, fading and blinking behaviors to indicate charging status and to allow the driver to signal a fare, a magnetic dash mount, and a diffuse glow in Lyft's signature, hot pink color. Though this was a relatively simple product, achieving a very exacting and refined industrial design is a time consuming process&mdash;and Lyft's timeline was aggressive. To further complicate matters, the color pink comprises red and blue. By law, cars may not have forward-facing red lights and blue is reserved for emergency vehicles. So, for both branding and legal reasons, we needed to ensure a very precise color match that didn't trend either too red or too blue under both transmitted and reflected lighting.

Mindtribe located a combination of overseas injection molders and domestic contract manufacturers. We traveled to China to meet with the injection molders to reduce iteration times while ensuring quality. We located a color specialist in Los Angeles and flew down to sit and test colors with them. Through a combination of creativity, skill, and brute force, we went from concept to production in just four months.

I planned and led the manufacturing phase of this program. My mechanical expertise is weak compared to my software and electrical expertise, so I found this mechanically intense program to be a skill-building and confidence-inspiring experience. During the course of the program, I noticed that my team was struggling with the problem of even illumination within the small volume of the glowstache. I jumped in and helped out with a deep dive into light spreading technology and discovered the solution that we used in production.
