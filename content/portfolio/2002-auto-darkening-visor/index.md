The BMW Technology Office asked Mindtribe to help them create an auto-darkening motorcycle helmet visor for racing applications. The idea was to create a helmet with an LCD dimming element that could respond to rapidly changing lighting conditions such as when a rider entered or exited a tunnel.

I wrote firmware for an [Analog Devices ADUC812](http://www.analog.com/en/products/processors-dsp/microcontrollers/8052-core-products/aduc812.html) microcontroller that samples a photocell and very precisely generates a driving waveform for the auto-dimming LCD element. I wrapped this up into a firmware application that allowed the BMW Technology Office to use a set of switches and potentiometers to adjust system parameters during their testing.
