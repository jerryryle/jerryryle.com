The BMW Technology Office in Palo Alto was researching new ways of presenting information to drivers using creative heads up display technologies.

I helped them explore one such concept by creating a streaming video system that projects live video onto physical surfaces with varying curvatures. I wrote a Windows application that uses DirectX technologies to map the video stream onto a virtual 3D object that can be manipulated to compensate for the curvature of the physical projection surface.
