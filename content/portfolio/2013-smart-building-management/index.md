[Verdigris](https://verdigris.co) partnered with Mindtribe to develop a system that uses artificial intelligence to improve commercial facilities management. Mindtribe built Verdigris' hardware platform while they focused on the backend and application.

When the teams began to encounter quality issues, the program manager brought me in to help diagnose and fix the problem. I discovered that the complexity of the system did not lend itself well to structured, end-to-end testing, so the teams were taking longer than usual to pinpoint and fix bugs. I recommended and helped architect a system that allowed for better testing, which improved the development workflow.

As Verdigris began their hiring efforts, I provided input to help with their job postings and their
interview process.
