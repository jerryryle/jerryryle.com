Verily Study Watch is a sensor-packed wearable device for non-invasive, continuous monitoring. The Investigational Study Watch is used in research and clinical studies, and the FDA-cleared Study Watch for ECG and Irregular Pulse Monitor is used in care collaborations with our partners.

My teams developed the watch firmware and algorithms (C++) as well as the companion mobile apps (iOS/Android). They also designed the security scheme and communication protocols between the watch and our cloud services.

Verily Study Watch was launched several years before I joined Verily, so I inherited a team largely working on maintenance. After I joined, we partnered with [iRhythm Technologies](https://www.irhythmtech.com) to add atrial fibrillation (AFib) detection to an updated watch design, which will expand iRhythm's offerings with a wrist-worn monitoring solution. This will be launched as the ZioÂ® Watch. On July 22, 2022, we [received FDA 510(k) clearance](https://verily.com/blog/fda-green-lights-irhythm-verily-zio-watch-and-zeus-system/) for the end-to-end cardiac arrhythmia solution. To achieve this outcome:

* I represented Verily engineering in initial meetings with iRhythm as we formed the partnership. As the program proceeded, I handed off the engineering relationship management to my Study Watch engineering manager, giving him a new leadership opportunity at which he excelled.
* I directed my team through new hardware and software investments in our watch platform. I contributed specific domain knowledge to solve an architectural challenge involving program space and cost tradeoffs.
* I justified additional headcount to increase our velocity to meet deadlines. We hired, onboarded, and increased velocity as promised.
* As he proved himself, I made space for my Study Watch engineering manager to excel. He did an amazing job. We hit our goals and the new development and new challenges slowed. I could see that his rapid growth was limited by the phase of the program, so I found a new opportunity elsewhere in the company and transferred him to another team for an exciting new challenge. This allowed me to expand the scope of another manager on my team, who fluidly transitioned into the new growth role.
