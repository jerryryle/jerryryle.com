Ferrari, faced with increasingly-demanding expectations around infotainment functionality and user
interface, wanted to explore how to modernize their infotainment experience by focusing on better
integration with Apple products. Apple put Ferrari in touch with Mindtribe because of our reputation
for having helped several major automotive manufacturers more closely integrate with iOS devices.
Mindtribe, along with our design partner, Ammunition, helped Ferrari define a new system
architecture and a flagship iOS app around which they could showcase their new technology.

Having deep experience with iOS accessory integration, I led the technical portions of our workshops
with Ferrari to help their management and technical teams understand and overcome the challenges
associated with this technology.
