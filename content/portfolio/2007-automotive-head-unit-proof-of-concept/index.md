An innovation team at a large automotive manufacturer was exploring a new head unit concept. They asked Mindtribe to help integrate a new LCD, touch panel, and buttons onto an existing head unit computer. Mindtribe was responsible for the electrical design, mechanical integration, and firmware for a microcontroller used to adapt the new inputs for use with the head unit's computer.

I structured and ran the firmware development effort for this program and helped with the system architecture. The firmware was written in C for a TI MSP430 microcontroller.
