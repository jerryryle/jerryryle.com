As I saw increasing demand for Mindtribe to develop smart iPhone accessories&mdash;especially in the
automotive space&mdash;I decided that we should invest in wrapping up our work to date into a
licensable library so that we could accelerate accessory development programs.

I built a highly portable C library and C++ reference application that implemented the entirety of
Apple's massive Made for iPhone (MFi) specification.
