A company was working on a robotic hand prototype. While they were versed in kinematics and high-level motion control, they were unfamiliar with low-level programming and communication protocols.

I wrote a C++ application for windows that communicates with a motion controller over RS232 and uses high-level motion control scripts to drive the hand prototype.
