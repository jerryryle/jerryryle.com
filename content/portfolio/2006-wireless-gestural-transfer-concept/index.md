A design firm asked Mindtribe to help them explore the idea of transferring data with a gesture. The concept was intended to simplify the act of transferring a digital business card or a file between two people in close physical proximity by using a gesture to initiate the transfer.

I wrote C firmware for a Freescale (now NXP) MC9S08GB60 microcontroller that uses an accelerometer for gesture recognition and transfers data between devices using a Freescale MC13192 radio.
