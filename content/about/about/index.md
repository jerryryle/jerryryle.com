I've been working in consumer, industrial, and medical spaces for over 20 years with a strong software/computer engineering focus. I'm primarily an engineering manager, but I enjoy acting as an individual contributor when I bring specific expertise. I'm the interface between management, sales, ops, and engineering. I grow and mentor engineering teams. I'm a strong product editor. I build class-leading products that solve problems.
