I'm currently looking for my next opportunity at a software-centric, growth-stage startup or mature business. I enjoy solving the technical and organizational problems required to help companies scale and sustain. As companies exit the early-stage startup churn of finding product market fit and enter the growth phase of scaling up and expanding, they often face the challenge of cleaning up after the necessary shortcut-taking while maintaining velocity and growing the team. I find this phase particularly fun and full of opportunity.

Industry-wise, I'm open to anything exciting and impactful, but I'm particularly interested in preventative health, IoT, communication, security, and privacy.
