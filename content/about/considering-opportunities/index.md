I'm currently looking for my next opportunity at a software-centric, growth-stage startup or mature business. I enjoy solving the technical and organizational problems required to help companies scale and sustain. As companies transition from the early-stage startup phase of seeking product-market fit to the growth stage of scaling and expanding, they frequently encounter the challenge of addressing previous shortcuts taken, while maintaining momentum and developing their team. I find this phase particularly fun and full of opportunity.

Industry-wise, I'm open to anything exciting and impactful, but I'm particularly interested in preventative health, IoT, communication, security, and privacy.
