                <h4>About Me</h4>
                <p>I've been working in hardware for 18 years with a strong software/computer engineering focus. I'm an
                    engineering manager now, but I still act as an individual contributor when I bring specific
                    expertise. I'm the interface between management, sales, ops, and engineering. I grow and mentor
                    engineering teams. I'm a strong product editor. I build class-leading products that solve customer
                    problems.</p>
                <p>I'm looking for a software-centric "series A/B" startup. I'm excited to solve the technical and
                    organizational problems required to take an MVP from product market fit to IPO. I'm particularly
                    interested in networks, communication, security, privacy, and cryptography.</p>
                <p>That's it for now. This site is a work in progress. There's content you can enjoy today, but check
                    back later for updates.</p>
                <p>Changelog: March 17, 2019 - Finally added resume. If you're not reading this message, the site's
                    probably complete. :)</p>

                <p>I joined Mindtribe as the sixth employee in January of 2001. Over the subsequent 16 years, I helped
                    build Mindtribe into a 40 person, world-class engineering firm. As a partner and vice president, I
                    was responsible for business development, sales, program management, process development, strategy,
                    hiring, and mentorship.</p>
                <p>During my time at Mindtribe, I figuratively wore a number of hats (few literally as I'm not a hat
                    person). Being a small team, we each had to sport a "get things done" attitude. In addition to
                    engineering, writing proposals, and fielding sales leads, my early role at Mindtribe included
                    managing our IT, building our websites, creating documentation templates and process tools, acting
                    as project librarian, cleaning the office, making coffee, and ensuring that everyone got a cake on
                    their birthday.</p>
                <p>As Mindtribe grew, I grew along with it. I became a more effective leader. I learned how to work
                    better with others and amplify their abilities. I became more confident and less afraid to give or
                    receive feedback. I learned that I didn't need to do everything myself and handed off
                    responsibilities for which others were more effective. I developed deep engineering skills and
                    insights spanning numerous technologies and industries.</p>
                <p>I now enjoy applying what I learned at Mindtribe to grow new companies.</p>

                <p>A medical device startup is creating an innovative surgical robotics system. They engaged Mindtribe
                    to create a medical-grade input device that surgeons will use to control the robots.</p>
                <p>I led the first half of this ongoing program, overseeing a team of mechanical, electrical, and
                    firmware engineers working towards a production-intent prototype. We collaborated with the client
                    and an industrial design firm to create experiential prototypes to narrow down the form factor and
                    ergonomic concerns. In parallel, we gathered system requirements, performed an FMEA to understand
                    how we were going to address safety issues, researched sterilization solutions, and kicked off the
                    system architecture.
                <p>Interesting technologies we researched during this program included industrial communication
                    protocols such EtherCAT, sterilization methods such as ethylene oxide and STERRAD®, and electrical
                    and firmware-level error mitigation/redundancy. The system was built with an NXP Kinetis K65 ARM
                    Cortex-M4F microcontroller.</p>
                <p>I left Mindtribe during this program, so I transitioned it to another Mindtribe VP. Our client had
                    originally planned to take the design into production themselves; however, our work impressed them
                    and, after I left, they extended Mindtribe's involvement to help them through production.</p>

                     width='960' height='400' />
                <p>Frustrated with the expense and ineffectiveness of existing consumer-oriented wine preservation
                    solutions, a startup took an innovative approach to the problem. Mindtribe to helped them refine
                    their existing prototype and prepare it for production.</p>
                <p>I led a team of electrical and firmware engineers to evaluate and redesign their existing prototype.
                    The product creatively uses a minimal set of sensors to observe the ambient conditions and chemical
                    reactions that impact wine storage. We needed to unravel a complicated set of possible conditions
                    and events to create robust, production-intent firmware. The product was powered by a single coin
                    cell, so we had to ensure that both the electrical and firmware systems were designed for ultra low
                    power. This system was built around an NXP Kinetis KL03 ARM Cortex-M0+ microcontroller.</p>

                <p>A medical device startup asked Mindtribe to help them develop a new version of their existing mobile
                    EKG product.</p>
                <p>I led a team of mechanical and electrical engineers to take the new design to production. We
                    identified and solved several signal integrity and power management issues, which ultimately led to
                    the product's success. We developed a factory test procedure and traveled to Shenzhen, China where
                    we worked with an injection molder and contract manufacturer to take the design through a successful
                    production build.</p>

                <p>A startup with deep security expertise was building an iPhone accessory that secured voice calls with
                    strong encryption. Because of our extensive experience with iPhone accessory development, they
                    reached out to Mindtribe to help them debug a problem with their communications stack.</p>
                <p>I began this program by leading a team of firmware engineers to diagnose and solve our client's
                    firmware issues. We quickly squashed a number of bugs and demonstrated an end-to-end encrypted call
                    using their hardware prototypes. The client then expanded our scope to help them finish the product
                    development and take it through production. I became their acting VP of Engineering and managed a
                    combination of our team, their team, an electrical consultant, an audio consultant, an app
                    development firm, a security auditor, and a contract manufacturer in the Philippines. Together, we
                    refined the electrical, mechanical, and firmware designs through a series of prototypes. Due to the
                    product's mechanical complexity, security requirements, and the required level of polish, we needed
                    to closely support the contract manufacturer. I repeatedly traveled to Manila with my team to help
                    the manufacturer through a series of builds over six months.</p>
                <p>I worked with the startup's CEO and sales team to plan the program around their launch and
                    fundraising needs. Because they lacked in-house technical critical mass, I also helped them with
                    their hiring efforts by screening and interviewing for them. When Mindtribe disengaged, I left them
                    with an engineering team capable of sustaining and evolving the product line.</p>
                <p>During this program, I had the opportunity to dive deep into some interesting technologies such as
                    encryption (AES, elliptic curve, and Diffie-Hellman), random number generation, realtime audio
                    CODECs and DSP, hardware security, injection molding, and ultrasonic welding. The system was built
                    with an NXP Kinetis K61 ARM Cortex-M4F microcontroller and a Cirrus Logic DSP.</p>

                <p>The <a class='anchor-scroll' href='#encrypted-communications-device'>Encrypted Communications
                    Device</a> project included a complicated cryptosystem that required the generation of a unique
                    identifier and cryptographic keys for each device's printed circuit board assembly (PCBA). This
                    provisioning step needed to be performed securely on the manufacturing line in Manila. For early
                    engineering test builds at the contract manufacturer, my engineering team was able to manually
                    perform the provisioning step and load the device firmware; however, we needed to build a station
                    that minimally-trained operators could use during production. Through the contract manufacturer, I
                    commissioned an electromechanical fixture to hold the PCBAs and make the appropriate connections to
                    the product's microcontroller. It was up to my team to write the provisioning software that would
                    use this fixture to allow operators to program PCBAs.</p>
                <p>As our manufacturing build date drew near, it became clear that my team was understaffed and wasn't
                    going to be able to complete the provisioning station software in time for our first production test
                    build. Manually provisioning units would have been incredibly painful for my team and would have
                    prevented us from achieving our goal of exercising the production-intent line. Because of this, and
                    because I had relevant expertise, I jumped in and wrote the required software&mdash;largely during
                    flights to/from Manila for other builds. The software:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Provided an operator-friendly user interface</li>
                    <li>Was capable of provisioning up to 4 PCBAs simultaneously</li>
                    <li>Was secure&mdash;as defined by our client's security officer</li>
                    <li>Could send encrypted provisioning results and statistics to our client</li>
                </ul>
                <p>I wrote the software in Python and used <a id='factory_kivy' href='https://kivy.org/'>Kivy</a> for
                    the user interfaces. Data was stored in SQLite databases and encrypted for transport between the
                    factory and our client using <a id='factory_gnupg' href='https://www.gnupg.org/'>gpg2</a>.

                <p>A startup offering mobile charging as a service was having quality problems with their devices. The
                    service operates via a deployment of smart batteries throughout urban areas. When users encounter
                    these smart batteries and connect their phones, they're prompted to sign into the startup's service
                    to pay for the battery usage. Unfortunately, the batteries would not reliably connect to various
                    Android phones. The issues seemed to be a combination of firmware and app-level bugs. Because of our
                    prior Android accessory and app experience, Mindtribe was asked to help debug the issues.</p>
                <p>I managed this program and planned/oversaw a short sprint during which my team debugged the issues
                    while I lent USB expertise to the program.</p>

                    headquartered in SF, engaged Mindtribe to work with <a id='lyft_ammunition'
                                                                           href='https://ammunitiongroup.com'>Ammunition</a>
                    to overhaul Lyft's iconic, fuzzy "carstache". Our mission was to create a smaller, sleeker, more
                    refined emblem that maintained the superb brand recognition Lyft had earned with their standout
                    'stache.</p>
                <p>We began by supporting Ammunition's concept creation/refinement phase through a series of studies and
                    prototypes to understand safety concerns, costs, and feasibility.</p>
                <p>Once Lyft and Ammunition selected the final "glowstache" concept, Mindtribe created the detailed
                    mechanical, electrical, and firmware design. The glowstache was effectively a very fancy flashlight.
                    It had an internal battery that recharged via a USB port, fading and blinking behaviors to indicate
                    charging status and to allow the driver to signal a fare, a magnetic dash mount, and a diffuse glow
                    in Lyft's signature, hot pink color. Though this was a relatively simple product, achieving a very
                    exacting and refined industrial design is a time consuming process&mdash;and Lyft's timeline was
                    aggressive. To further complicate matters, the color pink comprises red and blue. By law, cars may
                    not have forward-facing red lights and blue is reserved for emergency vehicles. So, for both
                    branding and legal reasons, we needed to ensure a very precise color match that didn't trend either
                    too red or too blue under both transmitted and reflected lighting.</p>
                <p>Mindtribe located a combination of overseas injection molders and domestic contract manufacturers. We
                    traveled to China to meet with the injection molders to reduce iteration times while ensuring
                    quality. We located a color specialist in Los Angeles and flew down to sit and test colors with
                    them. Through a combination of creativity, skill, and brute force, we went from concept to
                    production in just four months.</p>
                <p>I planned and led the manufacturing phase of this program. My mechanical expertise is weak compared
                    to my software and electrical expertise, so I found this mechanically intense program to be a
                    skill-building and confidence-inspiring experience. During the course of the program, I noticed that
                    my team was struggling with the problem of even illumination within the small volume of the
                    glowstache. I jumped in and helped out with a deep dive into light spreading technology and
                    discovered the solution that we used in production.</p>

                <p>Mindtribe is always looking for ways to build products faster. One such method is to invest in
                    intellectual property development that's ready for reuse on projects. To this end, we created
                    several microcontroller platforms with electrical reference designs and production-oriented firmware
                    codebases.</p>
                <p>I led programs to create the following platforms:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Corgi - A general-purpose microcontroller platform based upon the <a
                            id='microcontrollers_ti'
                            href='https://www.ti.com/microcontrollers/other-mcus/overview.html'>TI TM4C12x</a> (formerly
                        Stellaris) Cortex-M4F processor line. We created a microcontroller motherboard that hosts
                        daughterboards called "pups". Inspired by Arduino shields, the pups extend the platform's
                        functionality with sensors, actuators, battery chargers, etc. The schematics/layouts are created
                        in Altium using our production workflow, so reusing the work is trivial. I personally created a
                        firmware codebase that demonstrates a driver model with example programs and supports a
                        production build system with unit tests. This platform became an important part of Mindtribe's
                        hiring and onboarding efforts. We use the system in interviews and new hires extend it to learn
                        our development and production workflows.

                        production workflow. This was a highly leveraged platform that kickstarted multiple client
                        programs.

                <p>I structured and ran a development effort to prototype an input device that uses a unique touchpad to
                    convert gestures into alphanumeric input. The prototype communicated with the touchpad via USB and
                    performed gestural processing in Python, using Kivy to provide a GUI that visualized the results.</p>

                <p>I structured and ran a development effort to prototype a new remote control that incorporates

                    integration of our work, we built an Android-based remote control simulator that they used while our
                    hardware was under development. Once our hardware was ready, it took just a few hours to replace the
                    simulator with the actual hardware and re-tune the system.</p>

                <p>When the teams began to encounter quality issues, the program manager brought me in to help diagnose
                    and fix the problem. I discovered that the complexity of the system did not lend itself well to
                    structured, end-to-end testing, so the teams were taking longer than usual to pinpoint and fix bugs.
                    I recommended and helped architect a system that allowed for better testing, which improved the

                <p>Ferrari, faced with increasingly-demanding expectations around infotainment functionality and user
                    interface, wanted to explore how to modernize their infotainment experience by focusing on better
                    integration with Apple products. Apple put Ferrari in touch with Mindtribe because of our reputation

                <p>Adobe engaged Mindtribe to help them explore the use of hardware to enhance the mobile drawing
                    experience and bring back the familiar experience of drawing with pen and paper. We built a
                    connected stylus capable of producing beautiful strokes on an iPad. To support this effort,
                    Mindtribe wrote an iOS app to test and demonstrate the drawing capability of the stylus. During this
                    program, Adobe asked us to also explore the concept of a hardware ruler for technical drawing. We
                    prototyped this ruler and extended our test app with new functionality to support it. Around this
                    time, we were collectively coming to the conclusion that these prototypes were more than intriguing
                    concepts&mdash;they were potentially-shippable products.</p>
                <p>Adobe decided to proceed with the productization of the pen and ruler, to be sold as <a
                        id='adobe_adobe_inkslide' href='https://helpx.adobe.com/ink-and-slide.html'>Adobe Ink and
                    Slide</a>. They felt that evolving our test app into a polished drawing app as a skunkworks project
                    would be a faster path to a showcase app for the new drawing accessories than trying to get the
                    hardware support integrated into Adobe's existing apps.</p>
                <p>We dedicated Mindtribe developers to the application and I stepped in to manage it as its own program&mdash;codenamed
                    Project Parallel. I worked with Adobe's project manager to put together a production schedule that
                    aligned with the hardware release. Together, we ran the program using an agile methodology. The team
                    met weekly to plan each sprint and delivered features by demonstrating them at the subsequent
                    planning meeting. The iOS developers worked closely with Adobe's designers and Mindtribe's hardware
                    team to reduce integration cycles to hours. We moved blazingly fast.</p>
                <p>As the program progressed, we added iOS developers from Adobe to increase our velocity and
                    incorporate Adobe technologies such as Creative Cloud. I engaged Adobe's internationalization team
                    to help us plan early for internationalization and to perform the actual localization for the
                    countries in which the product would launch. I later engaged Adobe's quality assurance resources to
                    help us set up automated UI testing and to perform manual application testing with the hardware.</p>
                <p>Early in the program, I contributed to the iOS development itself; however, I was lucky enough to
                    have an exceptionally capable team and many Adobe resources, so I was able to step back and focus on
                    removing all program-level obstacles from their path.</p>

                <p>Square kicked Mindtribe off on their Point of Sale system design as we were wrapping up their <a
                        class='anchor-scroll' href='#secure-mobile-card-reader'>Secure Mobile Card Reader</a>. The
                    system, known as the Square Stand, is intended to appeal to brick-and-mortar stores that need a more
                    professional solution than the Mobile Card Reader offered. The Stand leverages an iPad for its
                    display and connectivity and allows users to connect barcode scanners, cash drawers, and receipt
                    printers through its USB hub.
                </p>
                <p>I structured and ran this program from concept through manufacturing. By this time, Square had a
                    sizable mechanical engineering team and a growing electrical team. Mindtribe led the firmware
                    development, contributed to the electrical design, and supported the mechanical design. I provided
                    cross-functional engineering management to keep the efforts in sync--often collocating at Square's
                    office and working with Square's new VP of hardware to understand and manage the requirements and
                    development effort.</p>
                <p>I contributed significantly to the firmware itself, kicking off the production codebase that ran on
                    an ST STM32F207VE ARM Cortex-M3 microcontroller. The Apple iPad does not directly support
                    accessories such as receipt printers, so our firmware's primary job was to act as a USB host for the
                    peripherals and shuttle data between them and the iPad using Apple's proprietary accessory protocol.
                    We also advanced our work from the Mobile Card Reader project and built a new, secure, dual-sided
                    magnetic stripe reader for the Stand.</p>
                <p>I oversaw the work performed by Mindtribe and Square, managed an iOS consultant who helped us develop
                    a stand SDK and test app, managed multiple hardware/software vendor relationships, and managed the
                    Stand's security auditing. As we transitioned the Stand to production, I helped Square set up the
                    manufacturing line at a contract manufacturer in Mexico, flying down repeatedly to ensure smooth
                    builds to keep us on schedule.</p>
                <p>During the Stand development, I helped Square interview, hire, and train their first firmware
                    developers and left Square with a team that was capable of sustaining and evolving the product
                    line.</p>

                <p>Square engaged Mindtribe to help them create a secure and more reliable version of their mobile
                    credit card reader. We helped them take this from concept through production. The design needed to
                    be secure, but very low cost and very low power.</p>
                <p>I structured and ran the firmware development effort for this reader. I worked with Square to
                    understand the security requirements and kicked off the production codebase. I then handed it off to
                    my team and managed the remainder of the development, overseeing our work and providing technical
                    expertise.</p>
                <p>We managed to pack magnetic stripe signal capture, signal decoding, AES encryption (with chaining,
                    message authentication, and a nonce), tamper resistance, and data transmission into a tiny TI MSP430
                    with 8KB of flash and 256 <i>bytes</i> of RAM. We developed the encryption code with outside
                    security experts and had them audit our work for security purposes.
                </p>
                <p>We worked with Square's security team to set up a factory programming workflow in China, including
                    secure key injection using a hardware security module.</p>

                <p>A design company engaged Mindtribe to help them develop a prototype for a desk scheduling device for
                    office environments with shared desks. This was to be a small, low power, cost-effective, networked
                    device that could be deployed to hundreds of desks in large enterprise environments.</p>
                <p>I structured and managed this program. I worked closely with the client to understand and capture the
                    requirements. Working with a project manager, I put together schedules and budgets for the program
                    and worked with the team to evaluate unit costs as we underwent component selection.</p>
                <p>We built a functional prototype that drove a display and communicated via Zigbee. We used a Renesas
                    RX62N microcontroller, which offered a means of driving a TFT display without the expense of a full

                <p>An input device company asked Mindtribe to help them explore a novel way of providing low-cost
                    multi-touch input using capacitive sensing elements and a traditional single-touch touchpad.</p>
                <p>I structured and managed a program to develop firmware for a Cypress CY8C24894 PSoC. This firmware
                    enumerates as a USB HID device and combines capacitive sensing elements and touchpad data to emulate
                    a multitouch input device.</p>

                <p>When Mindtribe moved into a new office on University Avenue on Palo Alto, we found ourselves with a
                    large, very visible window. We decided to create an interactive sign that would advertise our
                    existence and engage passersby.</p>
                <p>Working with a graphic designer, I built a tetromino-style game in Adobe Flash. I wrapped this Flash
                    game with a Windows application that connected to a modem, answered calls, provided DTMF control
                    over the game, took a photo of the player using a webcam, and posted high scores to our website.</p>
                <p>The high scores were keyed to a player's caller ID. I built out a web backend that allowed users to
                    "claim" their scores by entering their phone numbers and providing their names. These went into a
                    moderation queue before being publicly displayed on our website.</p>

                <p>Apnicure engaged Mindtribe to develop a better treatment for sleep apnea that is quiet and allows
                    users to breathe naturally through their nose without being restricted by a mask. Mindtribe worked
                    with ID and mechanical engineering firm, Whipsaw, to create this product. Mindtribe developed the
                    electrical and firmware designs and supported Whipsaw on the mechanical design.</p>
                <p>I structured and ran the firmware and application development for this product, managing our team and
                    an additional consultant. We built firmware that runs on an Atmel AT32UC3A1256 microcontroller,
                    which performs the pump control, data logging, and communications. We also wrote firmware for a
                    Cypress CY8C21334 PSoC to perform capacitive sensing for fluid level detection. We created several
                    C# Windows applications designed to allow physicians to configure treatment parameters and retrieve
                    usage logs.</p>

                     alt="BMW MINI Connected running on a MINI's head unit" width='960' height='400' />
                <p>Anticipating a need for agility in automotive environments to keep up with the constant evolution of
                    consumer smartphone features, the BMW Technology Office approached Mindtribe to help architect a new
                    software platform that would rapidly integrate smartphone innovations into the automotive user
                    experience. This effort involved two major components.</p>
                <p>First, both Apple and BMW had identified that head unit navigation and control of a music on a user's
                    phone was a major pain point for both users and automotive manufacturers. Apple had previously
                    exposed a massive API to allow accessories such as head units to browse a music collection on a
                    phone, retrieve album art, control playback, etc. This API was difficult for manufacturers to
                    consume, so the resulting experience was less than ideal and required users to learn a new,
                    unwieldy, interface for browsing their music collection.</p>
                <p>Apple, BMW, and Mindtribe collaborated to develop what became known as iPod Out. This specification
                    allowed an iPhone to "push" a user interface directly to a head unit's display over a video link.
                    The iPod Out functionality that launched with iOS 4 gave automotive manufacturers a native Apple
                    music interface through a much simpler API. It allowed users to control their music via the Apple
                    user interface with which they were already familiar.</p>
                <p>The second element that allowed for tighter phone integration in the car was a communications channel
                    between apps running on the phone and the car's head unit. BMW and Mindtribe worked to develop a
                    TCP/IP-based logical tunnel over the phone's physical USB connection to the car and a corresponding
                    protocol specification that would allow the head unit to exchange information with iOS Apps. While
                    our initial focus was primarily iOS, we simultaneously considered and proved feasibility on Android.
                    This functionality opened up a new generation of applications such as live driving tutorials that
                    can access the car's information as well as use the phone's sensor suite and network connectivity to
                    tell you how you could improve your driving.</p>
                <p>For these efforts, I created an iPhone accessory protocol stack, Linux communications simulators, and
                    proof of concept demonstration applications. I worked with an iOS consultant to develop the
                    tunneling technology for the app/head unit data exchange. I worked with BMW's head unit supplier to
                    capture requirements so that these new technologies could be put into production.</p>

                <p>Steelcase embarked on an effort with IDEO to redesign their popular, but aging RoomWizard room
                    scheduling device. This networked device was built around an older x86 architecture and included a
                    hard drive that was prone to failure over time. Steelcase asked Mindtribe to re-architect the
                    electrical and software system.</p>
                <p>I led the software architecture. I determined that rewriting the software was not a worthwhile
                    investment, considering the size of the effort. I delivered a report on how to reuse as much of the
                    existing Java application as possible with the new processor platform. I also helped investigate and
                    architect the addition of Zigbee for control of 3rd party devices from the RoomWizard.</p>

                <p>A leading industrial geopositioning company engaged Mindtribe to develop a computer vision system
                    prototype as part of an ongoing R&D effort to add advanced navigation capabilities to their existing
                    systems. Mindtribe built a system capable of recording and storing GPS-synchronized, high-resolution
                    video from multiple cameras.</p>
                <p>I helped configure a rugged computer with the exceptional memory and storage bandwidth needed to
                    capture and record video from multiple cameras simultaneously. I also wrote firmware for an NXP
                    LPC2148 Microcontroller that manages the synchronization of the camera triggering with a GPS. The
                    firmware transmits timestamped information via USB to the host PC that captures and records
                    video.</p>

                <p>Pure Digital engaged Mindtribe to create a new, higher end version of their point and shoot digital
                    video camera. This product existed before mobile phones were capable of video recording and was
                    wildly successful due to its ease of use and intuitive software for editing and sharing video.
                    Mindtribe was responsible for taking the new hardware design from concept through manufacturing
                    while Pure Digital focused on the application and backend software.</p>
                <p>I structured and ran the firmware development effort, while also writing firmware myself. We were
                    developing on a COACH 10 microprocessor from <a
                            id='puredigital_zoran' href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoran_Corporation'>Zoran</a>.
                    This was the first revision of this microcontroller capable of recording video at the framerate and
                    resolution that Pure Digital required, so we were highly incentivized to use it even though it was
                    newly-released and unproven. We completed our electrical design based upon the new chip before the
                    vendor had finished their own development board, so our first firmware task was to bring up a new
                    BSP on our own hardware and debug it with the vendor&mdash;effectively proving out their silicon and
                    software along with them. I got the video pipeline working and wrote drivers for all of the
                    peripherals, including the imaging sensor and LCD.</p>
                <p>We wanted to use a new, high quality LCD that wasn't directly compatible with the TFT interface on
                    the COACH 10, so I created a smart signal adapter using a Lattice CPLD programmed in Verilog HDL.
                    This converts the TFT signals to drive with the LCD and injects commands into the pixel stream to
                    control the LCD's horizontal and vertical sync.</p>
                <p>I also wrote the firmware for a Cypress CY8C21434 PSoC that handles both system power management and
                    capacitive touch inputs for the user interface.</p>

                    asked Mindtribe to help integrate a new LCD, touch panel, and buttons onto an existing head unit

                    for a microcontroller used to adapt the new inputs for use with the head unit's computer.</p>
                <p>I structured and ran the firmware development effort for this program and helped with the system
                    architecture. The firmware was written in C for a TI MSP430 microcontroller.</p>

                <p>A design firm asked Mindtribe to help them explore the idea of transferring data with a gesture. The
                    concept was intended to simplify the act of transferring a digital business card or a file between
                    two people in close physical proximity by using a gesture to initiate the transfer.</p>
                <p>I wrote C firmware for a Freescale (now NXP) MC9S08GB60 microcontroller that uses an accelerometer
                    for gesture recognition and transfers data between devices using a Freescale MC13192 radio.</p>

                     height='400' />
                <p>Ideal Software Systems makes cashless payment systems for the entertainment industry. They approached
                    Mindtribe looking to overhaul their existing hardware's industrial design, reduce system cost, and
                    add features. The device electrically interfaces with arcade games to replace coin acceptors and
                    ticket dispensers. There's no standard for these and the build quality varies wildly, so our
                    client's device had to offer configuration options that would handle numerous voltages,
                    poorly-grounded signals, transients, etc. The device also needed to survive attempted vandalism and
                    having Skee-Balls chucked at it.</p>
                <p>I helped architect the new system and led the firmware development effort. The system was built
                    around a <a
                            id='cashlessarcade_digi' href='https://www.digi.com/support/productdetail?pid=4667'>Rabbit
                        2000</a> microcontroller and we wrote firmware in C. One of our cost reduction measures was to
                    replace a very expensive RS232 barcode scanner module with an inexpensive, largely mechanical module
                    that did no onboard processing. This meant we needed to do the signal acquisition and barcode
                    processing ourselves. Ease of barcode scanning and low cost were both key to the adoption of this
                    system in arcades. Low cost meant that the cashless play cards were printed using extremely cheap
                    technology, so the barcodes were of poor quality--often with gaps or blurred edges. I developed my
                    own algorithms to maximize scan success by applying various error corrections to the scanned signal.
                    With these, we were able to achieve scan success rates better than the original, expensive barcode
                    module (as determined by user tests) at a fraction of the cost.</p>
                <p>Along with barcode scanning, I wrote firmware to precisely measure and generate signals to fool the
                    arcade games into thinking they were receiving quarters or dispensing tickets at the appropriate
                    times and to display status on the device's graphical LCD.</p>
                <p>The device also participated on a LAN to exchange data with Ideal's backend database. I wrote all of
                    the the networking firmware for the new system and worked with Ideal to ensure the devices behave
                    well when hundreds are deployed onto the same network.</p>

                <p>Input device startup, United Keys, asked Mindtribe to create a prototype of a keyboard that features
                    keys with context-aware OLED screens embedded in them. This very early precursor to the Touch Bar on
                    Apple's current Macbook Pro allowed the keyboard to provide application-specific functions.
                    Mindtribe created a functional prototype for United Keys' investor demonstrations.</p>
                <p>I wrote C firmware for an Atmel AT91SAM764 ARM microcontroller to drive the LCDs and enumerate as a
                    composite USB device that includes a keyboard and CDC interface (virtual serial port). The CDC
                    interface provides the mechanism for exchanging image files to be displayed on the LCDs. I wrote a
                    C++ Windows application to convert images to a format usable by the keyboard. I also wrote a C++
                    Browser Helper Object (BHO, aka Internet Explorer plugin) that our client used to demonstrate the
                    keyboard's functionality. The BHO changes the functionality of the context-aware keys based upon the
                    website that the user was currently visiting.</p>

                <p>An optics company built a new type of camera for aerospace and medical applications. They contacted
                    Mindtribe to help them create a Windows device driver for the camera.</p>
                <p>I developed a Windows WDM stream-class video capture driver for Windows XP and accompanying DirectX
                    plug-ins/filters to make the camera easy to use with DirectX applications. I also developed a
                    command-line program to control camera parameters.</p>
                <p>During this project, I discovered that the WDM stream-class base driver had an undocumented "feature"
                    that caused the video pipeline to stall if the pixel at 0,0 was true black (RGB value of 0). I
                    diagnosed this by debugging into the compiled base driver from Windows and reverse engineering it
                    from assembly. I'm still not certain why this occurred nor why it didn't seem to impact other
                    cameras. I can only surmise that most cameras never produce true black due to their noise floor. The
                    camera for which I was developing did produce true black at pixel 0,0 due to an in-camera graphical
                    overlay feature that happened to put a black square in that corner.</p>

                <p>Flow International, the inventor of and world leader in waterjet cutting solutions engaged Mindtribe
                    to explore sensor technologies that would allow them to cut contoured materials. Like a laser, the
                    water jet is focused and needs to remain at a constant distance from the material it is cutting. The
                    ability to cut contoured material requires that the cutting machine can track the distance from the
                    jet to the material as it cuts. The harsh environment and low-visibility in a waterjet cutter makes
                    this a difficult problem. Mindtribe built a sensor head prototype that contacts the material and
                    tracks distance using hall effect sensors.</p>
                <p>I led the firmware effort for this design. The firmware runs on a Motorola (subsequently Freescale,
                    now NXP) MC68HC908GR16 microcontroller. It samples and linearizes data from the Hall Effect sensors,
                    applies calibration constants, and sends the sensor data to the waterjet cutter via RS485.</p>

                <p>Colby Instruments, the industry leader in high-precision programmable delay line instruments, needed
                    to upgrade their design from an Intel 8085 microcontroller board that had been obsoleted and was no
                    longer available. They asked Mindtribe to replace the controller with a <a
                            id='colby_digi' href='https://www.digi.com/support/productdetail?pid=4667'>Rabbit 2000</a>-based
                    module.</p>
                <p>I supported the electrical redesign and led the firmware development effort. The delay line uses a
                    stepper motor to adjust the length of an electromechanical "trombone" that physically alters the
                    length of a signal path to precisely delay a signal. We were able to use the old firmware as a
                    reference, but we built all new firmware in C for the new controller module. This included stepper
                    motor drivers, an RS232-based user interfaces, and a <a
                            id='colby_wikipedia' href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE-488'>GPIB</a> interface. We
                    also added a LAN interface that supports the <a id='colby_ni' href='https://www.ni.com/visa/'>National

                <p>Biogy, a startup specializing in biometric technology, developed groundbreaking new algorithms that
                    reduced the complexity&mdash;and thus the system cost&mdash;of scanning and matching fingerprints.
                    They asked Mindtribe to help prepare their algorithms for production and to produce a hardware
                    reference design that would showcase their technology. This design was to be a lock that could be
                    opened or closed with the correct fingerprint.</p>
                <p>I worked closely with the mathematician who developed the fingerprint algorithms to port them to
                    embedded C code that runs on an Atmel AT91FR4042 microcontroller and acquires fingerprints via an
                    Atmel AT77C101B thermal fingerprint sensor. To make theft of their intellectual property more
                    difficult, Biogy wished to keep their firmware encrypted with AES in the microcontroller's flash.
                    The fingerprint algorithms operate in several discrete and independent phases, so I divided the code
                    up by phase, linked each into the same location in RAM using overlays, and wrote an elf encryption
                    tool to encrypt each phase's compiled code. I built a runtime loader that would load the current
                    phase's encrypted code from flash into RAM, decrypt it, perform the phase's function, and then zero
                    RAM before proceeding to the next phase. Clearly this scheme isn't foolproof, but it increases the
                    effort required to steal and reverse engineer the intellectual property.</p>

                    microcontroller, which provides both the 3D and the basic USB mouse functionality using an Agilent
                    imaging sensor. On this project, I experienced the frustration of not being able to trust the
                    compiler. The only available compiler for this microcontroller merrily generated invalid code for
                    certain valid (and pedestrian) C constructs. My development cycle involved coding, compiling, and
                    checking the assembly output listing for errors before bothering to try downloading and running the
                    firmware. I don't recommend this, but I did manage to get the product shipped on time.</p>

                    was interested in creating a handheld device that could identify a bird's species by its song. This
                    was before the age of smartphones and apps, so they contacted Mindtribe to explore the feasibility
                    of creating a dedicated hardware device for this purpose.</p>
                <p>I led the platform and software development aspect of this research. We flew to Cornell and MIT to
                    meet with top researchers in this field (yes, there is a bird voice recognition field of study). I
                    researched algorithms and processing requirements to understand the hardware cost and development
                    effort for such a system.</p>
                <p>Ultimately, our study concluded that an automated bird identification device would be too expensive
                    for even a niche enthusiast market. And that, given that researchers were not achieving compelling
                    results on desktop computers, the performance of an embedded system would be underwhelming. We
                    delivered a comprehensive body of research along with the crushed dreams.</p>

                <h4>Video Control and Telestration System (2004)</h4>
                <img class='img-fluid rounded mb-2 lazyload' src='media/tiny/Video_Telestration_System.jpg'

                     width='960' height='400' />
                <p>A video telestration startup had contracted a firm in India to develop a large software application
                    that would run on a hardware appliance and allow users to control and annotate live video.
                    Unfortunately, the startup was encountering severe quality issues with the deliverables from the
                    contractor. They originally reached out to Mindtribe to explore the possibility of having us start
                    over.</p>
                <p>I evaluated the situation and the code from the other team. I determined that the codebase was not a
                    lost cause, that it made no economic sense to throw it out and start over, and that the quality
                    problems stemmed largely from a communication issue between our client and their contractor. Our
                    client did not have experience providing technical specifications, so they were giving the
                    development team poor direction. The development team was largely guessing at what needed to be
                    built. This was compounded by the geographic separation of the teams. To correct this, I sat down
                    with the client and worked with them until I had a detailed understanding of their desired
                    functionality and I had clarified points of ambiguity. I translated this into a detailed software
                    specification for the contractor. With this improved mutual understanding of what was being built,
                    the relationship between our client and their contractor improved dramatically.</p>
                <p>I do not believe in communicating exclusively through specifications; however, sometimes they are an
                    effective tool for getting everyone on the same page.</p>

                <p>A startup was working on a novel scent delivery system that could precisely deliver a puff of scent
                    to a targeted location in a room. This was intended for entertainment or advertising applications
                    where one might care to target a single individual instead of filling a room with scent. The startup
                    worked with Mindtribe to diagnose electrical noise in their system and improve the design.</p>
                <p>I assisted with the electrical design overhaul and improvements to our client's Windows demonstration
                    application. Unfortunately, the client had lost the demonstration application's source code they had
                    previously written. Of course, this occurred days before a major demonstration of their technology
                    to investors and they needed to modify the app for the demonstration. I was able to reverse engineer
                    the application binary and patch it with the desired modifications in time for the demonstration.
                    When things calmed down after the big investor demo, I took a moment to teach our client how to use
                    a source control system to prevent future incidents of this nature.</p>

                <p>A medical device startup needed to precisely dispense very tiny droplets of fluid for testing and
                    characterization of their product. They asked Mindtribe to help them drive a piezoelectric dispenser
                    for this purpose.</p>
                <p>I created a Windows application that controls a 3NETICS PicoSpot piezoelectric dispensing head over
                    an RS485 link (via an off-the-shelf RS485 to RS232 adapter). The application gave our client fine
                    control over the quantity and location of the dispensed fluid.</p>

                    onto physical surfaces with varying curvatures. I wrote a Windows application that uses DirectX
                    technologies to map the video stream onto a virtual 3D object that can be manipulated to compensate
                    for the curvature of the physical projection surface.</p>

                <p>Dinan is an automotive tuner that creates high quality, after-market performance modifications for
                    BMWs. Their work is highly-regarded and covered by a comprehensive warranty in cooperation with BMW
                    of North America. Unlike software-only tuners, Dinan focuses on hardware modifications that are
                    supported by tuning the Engine Control Unit's (ECU) firmware to accommodate the hardware
                    changes.</p>
                <p>When Dinan started out in 1979, the founders were able to look at an ECU's flash dump in a hex editor
                    and spot the control tables that they needed to adjust to tune an engine for a modification. As
                    engines became more complex, looking at the data inside the code was no longer sufficient--they
                    needed to understand the code itself. Dinan asked Mindtribe to help them achieve this
                    understanding.</p>
                <p>Using the disassembler, <a id='dinan_ida' href='https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/index.shtml'>IDA
                    Pro</a>, I helped Dinan reverse engineer the ECU firmware for several BMW models, including ones
                    that used multi-processor ECUs. I picked apart the assembly to gain an understanding of how Dinan
                    would need to patch the firmware for a given hardware modification. In order to upload patched
                    firmware to an ECU, I also had to reverse engineer the handshake that the ECU performed to
                    authenticate an authorized uploader. Depending upon the car model, this varied from being based upon
                    a simple CRC to requiring public-key based cryptographic signatures.</p>

                <p>Consumer electronics startup, Ten Technology, engaged Mindtribe to create an infrared remote control
                    for the iPod. This allows users to control their music collection from across the room. Ten's remote
                    control has the honor of being the first "smart" iPod accessory and it pioneered Apple's official
                    Made for iPod program that launched the market for smart accessories.</p>
                <p>At the time, Apple did not yet have an official connected accessory program for the iPod. So, I used
                    an oscilloscope and my knowledge of communications protocols to reverse engineer Apple's wired
                    remote control. I then helped write the assembly code that receives IR remote commands and
                    translates them into iPod control commands, running on a tiny <a
                            id='ten_microchip' href='https://www.microchip.com/wwwproducts/en/PIC12C508A'>Microchip
                        PIC12C508A</a>.</p>
                <p>Ten Technology demonstrated their remote control prototype to Apple in the hopes of having it sold in
                    Apple Stores. Apple was impressed with the polish and utility of the product. They gave us a tiny
                    text file with the official protocol specification and told Ten that if they could revise the
                    product to support an upcoming iPod model, Apple would not only carry Ten's product in the Apple
                    Store, but they would mention it at the launch for the new iPod. And thus the Made for iPod program
                    was born. We worked around the clock to revise the product and hit the launch.</p>
                <p>In addition to working on the remote control itself, Mindtribe helped Ten through manufacturing and

                <p>AMD worked with Mindtribe to build a precise thermal test platform for processor performance
                    profiling under specific conditions. Mindtribe built a modular electrical system capable of

                <p>The BMW Technology Office was working with a specialist to create optics for a heads up display in a
                    racing helmet. They contacted Mindtribe to produce electronics for this helmet concept. The helmet
                    would receive messages from a pit crew via a radio on the car's CAN bus. The helmet would then
                    display graphics pertaining to the messages through the special optics. Drivers would be able to see
                    both these graphics and the road simultaneously without refocusing their eyes.</p>

                <p>The BMW Technology Office was exploring the integration of an IP-based LAN inside a car. Cars use
                    several CAN and other proprietary buses, which make it difficult to add new devices to a car's
                    network. Using a standardized LAN could open up new integration and interoperability possibilities.
                    As a part of their exploration, the BMW Technology Office asked Mindtribe to help develop an IP
                    video camera to stream video over an in-car LAN. For a demonstration, the video was to be streamed
                    simultaneously to a web browser on the car's head unit and to a laptop outside of the car.</p>
                <p>At the time, IP-based video cameras were not commonplace. Though a few did exist, they were too large
                    to integrate into a car. Mindtribe built a tightly integrated IP camera using a new USB imaging
                    sensor from Agilent and a small embedded Linux computer based upon the <a
                            id='bmw_axis' href='http://developer.axis.com/old/products/etrax100lx/'>AXIS Communications
                        ETRAX 100LX</a> processor.</p>
                <p>I specified and configured the embedded Linux computer, wrote a Linux device driver for the imaging
                    sensor, created a Linux streaming video service, and wrote a Java web applet to connect to the video
                    service and decode/display the streaming video. I learned that I should not make presumptuous
                    graphical design decisions and that large, multinational corporations have logo usage guidelines
                    that do not include their logo's use as a spinning loading icon while buffering video. The BMW
                    Technology Office gave me polite feedback and graphical assets to use in the logo's stead. They
                    received the end result with acclaim.</p>

                <p>A consumer electronics company wanted to explore the use of gestural navigation in a handheld device.
                    They wanted to see how it would feel if the device's screen acted more like a "window" to content
                    underneath. That is, instead of scrolling the content with your finger, you moved the device itself
                    in space over content that appeared to remain stationary underneath. To prototype this, we
                    instrumented an <a id='gid_wikipedia' href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPAQ'>HP iPAQ</a> handheld
                    device with gyroscopes and distance sensors. I wrote firmware to process the sensors and send the
                    data to a Windows CE application that allows a user to navigate a section of a map by moving the
                    iPAQ around. The first application version panned and zoomed a bitmap image of the map, which did
                    not allow for enough zoom without looking "fuzzy". I then tried embedding an Adobe Flash player in
                    the app to use vector-based content; however, this heavyweight component did not yield acceptable
                    performance and felt too sluggish. I then tinkered with bitmap tiling to achieve better resolution
                    within the iPAQ's limited resources, but ultimately wrote an SVG parser/renderer (none existed for
                    Windows CE at the time) and dramatically improved the experience with lightweight vector graphics
                    support.</p>
                <p>This concept proved to be a very fun toy, but we thought it impractical for serious use. Our client
                    concluded similarly.</p>

                    engaged Mindtribe to develop their first product: a smart power strip that would allow users to
                    remotely monitor and control appliances.</p>
                <p>Cyber Switching originally envisioned their product simply as a way to allow network administrators
                    to reboot frozen routers remotely. As the program progressed and they spoke to customers, it became
                    clear that the product needed to offer more. Luckily, Mindtribe's agile approach allowed us to keep
                    up with Cyber Switching's evolving understanding of their market. We worked closely with them to
                    help them understand feasibility and costs. We ultimately arrived at a product that could control
                    appliances, but also monitor their power usage and provide alerts or even shut off power when
                    configurable conditions were encountered.</p>
                <p>The product offers three physical interfaces</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>RS232 - compatible with legacy IT equipment, this interface provides a complete user interface
                        for monitoring, control, and configuration.
                    </li>
                    <li>Telephone - this allows administrators to connect the unit to a phone line. They can then dial
                        into it and control/monitor outlets via audio prompts and DTMF input. I worked with contracted
                        voice talent to prepare the script and audio samples that would fit in our limited flash space.
                    </li>
                    <li>LAN - this interface allows the units to participate on networks via a number of protocols:
                        HTTP, SNMP, SNTP, and Telnet
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>I helped with the electrical design of this product and wrote almost all of the firmware. This
                    product was built around the <a id='cyberswitching_digi'
                                                    href='https://www.digi.com/support/productdetail?pid=4667'>Rabbit
                        2000</a> microcontroller&mdash;the most accessible TCP/IP-enabled microcontroller at the time.
                    While the microcontroller vendor provided some of the network protocol libraries, I extended most of
                    them and built the SNMP agent from scratch. I also built a dynamic, embedded web page for the
                    product that allowed for near realtime control/monitoring long before AJAX methods were established
                    for doing such things. The microcontroller wasn't capable of TLS at the time; however, I extended
                    the HTTP server with an <a id='cyberswitching_wikipedia'
                                               href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digest_access_authentication'>HTTP
                        digest authentication</a> mechanism. This type of HTTP authentication was never widely adopted
                    due to the rise of TLS, but it allowed Cyber Switching to provide a cost-effective authentication
                    method that was more secure than sending the credentials in plaintext. At the time, this was above
                    and beyond the industry standard for security in similar embedded devices and it became a selling
                    point for the product that appealed to IT admins.</p>
                <p>My codebase was leveraged to build over sixteen products during Cyber Switching's formative
                    years.</p>

                <h4>CNC PCBA Drill Software (1998)</h4>

                <p>Cal Poly has an amazing class, IME 157, that teaches students about electronic product manufacturing
                    processes by having them build an electronic product themselves. In this class, students use CAD to
                    capture a schematic and lay out a PCB. They then drill and etch the PCB, solder on the components,
                    and build a simple sheet metal enclosure. At the end of the course, each student has created a
                    working product such as a car alarm, strobe light, etc.
                </p>
                <p>The IME 157 lab features a high-speed, Computer Numerical Control (CNC) drill for drilling PCBs. When
                    I took the course, the software for this drill was an ancient command-line program that performed no
                    error checking. If a student produced a drill file with errors, such as holes placed outside of the
                    drillable area (very easy to do accidentally in the CAD package), the software would happily rev the
                    drill table up to full speed and slam it into its end-stops. Repeatedly throughout the quarter&mdash;despite
                    numerous warnings from the instructor&mdash;students would forget to check their drill files. The
                    drill table would slam, the entire class would jump, and the instructor would run to fix the drill
                    so that work could proceed.
                </p>
                <p>Certain that I could overcome the CNC drill software's limitations, I volunteered to rewrite it and
                    the instructor gave me access to the drill outside of class hours. Finding little documentation on
                    the ancient <a id='cncdrill_deltatau' href='http://www.deltatau.com'
                                   title='Delta Tau has more online documentation these days.'>Delta Tau</a> brand
                    motion controllers, I reverse-engineered their protocol and wrote a completely new version of the
                    control software in Pascal (my most proficient language at the time). This new software alerts users
                    about invalid drill files, displays a graphical preview of the drill pattern before drilling so that
                    students can visually inspect for alignment/scale problems, and improves overall drill time by
                    optimizing the drill's motion path and S-curve profiles.
                </p>
                <p>After completing the class myself, I went on to T.A. IME 157 for several quarters, becoming an expert
                    in the OrCAD CAD package for PCBA design and continuing to find ways to improve the curriculum and
                    materials.
